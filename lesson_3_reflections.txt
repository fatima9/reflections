When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?
When it has to be shared with multiple people to work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if it automatically updates then it might update when we are not yet finished completely but are in between.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
All the three creates a copy of the code. Branch can be used when you have to work on adding something new to the existingone and doesnt want to experiment 
on the original code. Clone can be used to copy the repository from the remote machine to the local and also in your local computer to different location.
Fork is similar to clone but is used to make a copy of repositories within the git hub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?  
It helps in deciding on tht type of merge.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We could do it through team viewer but it creates a problrm to one of tht the user as he cannot do his work hehas to wait andeven sending 
through emails would involve lot of downloading stuff everytime.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When they are changes in your local machine as wee as changes made by some other user on the github. So we can make changes on a different
branch and then merge them.
