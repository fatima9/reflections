When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?
When it has to be shared with multiple people to work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if it automatically updates then it might update when we are not yet finished completely but are in between.
