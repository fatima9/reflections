What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when the repository is initialized it creates a .git file.It is used to keep the track of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area consists of the files that are yet to be committed. The working directory consists of untracked files and the repository consists of the committed files.
The staging area allows us to choose which files are to be committed at a time.
